Nandini Bahirgonde – Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site presents my academic background, technical skills, course experience, projects, creative work, and personal interests in a clear and organized format. It is designed to serve as a comprehensive introduction to my work and identity as a computer science student.

The live website is available at:
https://nandinibahirgonde.github.io/portfolio

Purpose of the Website

The primary objective of this portfolio is to provide a professional and accessible online presence that highlights:

My academic accomplishments and relevant coursework

Technical projects and demonstrations of my programming experience

Leadership roles, campus involvement, and extracurricular work

Creative interests, including vocal performance and musical collaboration

Contact information and external links for recruiters, collaborators, and visitors

This portfolio functions as a consolidated platform for showcasing the work I have done and the skills I continue to develop.

Repository Structure

The repository includes the following core files that make up the website:

index.html – The homepage containing an introduction, summary of experience, coursework, skills, and hero section.

projects.html – A detailed list of projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links.

activities.html – A page highlighting creative work, including vocal performances, Sur Devils involvement, and embedded media.

contact.html – A page with contact information, external links, and a simple contact section.

style.css – Custom CSS used for layout, color schemes, transitions, and responsive design.

profile.png – Profile image displayed on the homepage.

All files are written and maintained manually.

Features
Responsive Design

The layout is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Tailwind CSS and custom styling ensure consistent spacing, scaling, and readability across screen sizes.

Dark Mode Functionality

The site includes a working theme toggle system that allows users to switch between light and dark mode. The theme preference persists based on local storage.

Embedded Media

The Activities page contains an embedded Instagram performance video. This integration provides a direct view of my vocal performance work and creative interests, complementing the written descriptions on the page.

Modern Visual Design

The site incorporates smooth transitions, scroll-based fade effects, gradient backgrounds, structured content blocks, and clean typography to create a polished appearance.

Clear Navigation Structure

The website is organized into four main pages—Home, Projects, Activities, and Contact—accessible through a top navigation bar.

Use of Video Content

A performance video is embedded within the Activities page to provide a more dynamic and personal element to the portfolio. Video is used to demonstrate:

Creativity outside of academics

Vocal performance skills

Musical collaboration

Personal expression and confidence

Including video content enhances the depth of the portfolio by offering a medium that communicates aspects of my work that cannot be conveyed through text or images alone.
